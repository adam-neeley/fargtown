# Copycat

A translation of Melanie Mitchell's original Copycat project from Lisp to
Python. To find the original information and source code for Copycat, see her
[website](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/).

The translation of the core logic is 100% complete, and a proper GUI is in the works. For now, you can run a problem on the command line:

```
python3 Copycat.py --quiet abc abd ijk
```
