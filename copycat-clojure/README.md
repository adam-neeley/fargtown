# copycat-clojure

A port of Melanie Mitchell's Copycat model to Clojure. See:

* Melanie Mitchell's [original lisp code](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/how-to-get-copycat.html) (in an obsolete Lucid/Sun Common Lisp using [flavors](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.lang.lisp/g8-Xb_ko_YA) for OO)

* [Python port](https://github.com/jtauber/co.py.cat) - this probably has the cleanest code, but no graphics.

* [Java port](http://itee.uq.edu.au/~scottb/Copycat.html) - this actually runs faithfully with all the graphics, in the browser!
