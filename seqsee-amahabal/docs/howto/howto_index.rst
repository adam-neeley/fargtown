How to ...
============

This section describes how to achieve various things, both mundane and otherwise
(e.g., both "how to install pySeqsee" and "how to design with subspaces" will be
addressed).

Installation
----------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   install

Running
----------------

PySeqsee provides different modes of running an applications. It supports both running a single example
(and seeing it visually on the screen), and running in batch (where multiple runs for each input are
undertaken and statistics such as success rate and distribution of time taken on various runs is
shown). Another mode of running PySeqsee is the Side-by-side mode, where two sets of runs are done,
differing on the value of some flag to assist in experimentation.

Creating a new app
------------------------

Creating a new app is described in :doc:`../new_app/new_app_index`
