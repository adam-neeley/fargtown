How to display the workspace in the GUI
========================================

The workspace is one of the several possible views in the central pane of the
GUI display. The display is handled by a subclass of ViewPort, and a toy version
is generated by the skeleton application generator, which should be present in
the file 'gui/workspace_view.py' in the application directory.

ReDrawView
------------

This is the only function you need to modify. The function gets the controller
as input, and thereby can access the workspace. The method can draw anywhere on
the central canvas, but to restrict to the area of the workspace, you should
follow the following convention.

The signature of the method::

  def ReDrawView(self, controller):
    pass

To obtain the size of the drawable box allocated to the workspace display::

  self.width
  self.height

For a given coordinate in this box (where (0, 0) is the top left), the coordinate
of the full canvas is available::

  x, y = self.CanvasCoordinates(10, 10)

Given these coordinates, you can use any of the tkinter canvas methods to draw (see
http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm). These include::

  self.canvas.create_text(...)
  self.canvas.create_oval(...)
  self.canvas.create_image(...)
