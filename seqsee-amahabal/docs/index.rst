 PySeqsee: A Cognitive Architecture for High-level Perception
==============================================================

Welcome! This is the documentation for PySeqsee |release|, last updated |today|.

PySeqsee is an open-source Python 3 framework for writing programs to 
solve complex problems that are not amenable to brute-force solutions.  
The programs created using Pyseqsee have a blackboard architecture and are 
akin to the computer program `Seqsee 
<https://sites.google.com/a/amahabal.com/main/files/Seqsee--doublesided.pdf>`_ 
whose goal is to extend integer sequences in a human-like way.  PySeqsee 
attempts a clean separation of the domain-specific aspects of applications 
from the domain-independent parts.

        Under development. Although started many years ago, it had been dormant until late
        2016. Work on it has restarted, and is gaining steam as of Jan 2017. At this stage, PySeqsee 
        is alpha software.  If you wish to change that, help is greatly appreciated.
