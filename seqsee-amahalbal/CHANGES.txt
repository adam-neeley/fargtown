Changes in PySeqsee in reverse chronological order:

June 5, 2012, Release 0.2
===========================

34 commits with these highlights:

* A shiny new batch mode and SxS mode GUI with pretty pie charts and stats comparing with
  previous runs.
* More documentation. A lot more is still needed, but the How To section is somewhat improved.
* Enriched the skeleton app generator and started a tutorial explaining how a new app can
  be created.
* A new standard location now for saving files such as LTMs and statistics of batch runs.
  These will be in ~/.pyseqsee/{app_name}.

Seqsee:

* A lot of cleanup, ability to see pseudo-periodic sequences such as "1 7 2 8 3 9"
* Allowing multiple mappings between groups. Allows Seqsee to get out of ruts (for example,
  in "2 3 5 7 11...", if it saw 2-3 as being numeric successor instead of Prime successor,
  it could previously get stuck. Now it doesn't.)
* More consistent use of categories. This allowed Seqsee to see "1 7 2 11 3 13", which it
  did not despite the previous change.
* A lot of code cleanup.
* The UI is richer, with more things visible.
* FindMapping completely refactored.
