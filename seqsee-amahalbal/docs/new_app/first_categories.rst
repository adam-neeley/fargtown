First Categories
===================

Categories are the stars in the Bongard domain: what we are trying to find is a category that has
all items on the left as members and none of the items on the right as members. On this page, we
will take our first steps by defining a category---Squares---and a family of categories---Modulo.

The focus is still on the mechanics of how to do this, and subsequently we will delve deeper into
cognitive considerations.

Categories, Categorizable, and Bindings
------------------------------------------

We need to get some notation out of the way. When I say *category* on this page, I am referring to
such things as the category "even number", "prime number", and to take two examples not from this
domain, "chairs" and "common first name". For now, this can be thought of as a set of items with
degrees of membership (but much more will be said later).

By a *categorizable*, I mean a Python object that has the necessary routines to keep track of
categories that it belongs to. This can be achieved by subclassing from the interface
:py:class:`~farg.core.categorization.categorizable.CategorizableMixin`.

Finally, a binding can be thought of as an explanation for how an item is an instance of a category.
For instance, one may explain that "16" is a square by saying that the square root is 4. This can
open the possibility of seeing how "16" is related to "25 by using the relationships between the
bindings. Formally, a binding is an instance of 
:py:class:`~farg.core.categorization.binding.Binding`.

Turning IntegerObject into a Categorizable
--------------------------------------------

In farg/apps/bongard/workspace.py, let's turn IntegerObject into a categorizable. To do this, we
need to add a super-class. No extra methods are needed. ::

  from farg.core.categorization.categorizable import CategorizableMixin

  class IntegerObject(CategorizableMixin):
    # Existing stuff.

Adding the category "Square"
------------------------------

The file farg/apps/bongard/categories.py already exists, and we will add the new category to this.
Our category must inherit from :py:class:`~farg.core.categorization.category.Category`, and it should
define the method IsInstance that would return a Binding object. ::

  class Square(Category):
    """Category whose instances are IntegerObject that are square numbers."""

    def BriefLabel(self):
      return "Square"

    def IsInstance(self, entity):
      magnitude = entity.magnitude
      if magnitude < 0:
        return None  # Not an instance.
      root = math.sqrt(magnitude)
      if root != int(root):
        return None
      return Binding(sqroot=root)

What can we do with this?
---------------------------

What does this enable us to do? Here is a sampler. ::

  i7 = IntegerObject(7)
  i9 = IntegerObject(9)
  sq = Square()
  b = i7.DescribeAs(sq)  # b will be None
  b = i9.DescribeAs(sq)  # b won't be none.
  b = i9.DescribeAs(sq)  # No recalculation: i9 can remember its categories.
  i9.IsKnownAsInstanceOf(sq)
  b = i9.GetBindingsForCategory(sq)  # Requires it to be a known instance

Creating a class of categories
----------------------------------

We will create the class of categories called X mod N. As an illustration, consider the category
3 mod 4. This contains numbers that, when divided by 4, leave a remainder of 3. Examples of this
are 3, 7, 11, and also -1, -5 and -9.

The binding we return here is the integer part of that division. For 3, we return the binding k=0
because 3 divided by 4 is 0, plus a remainder of 3. For 11, we get k=2, since 11 divided by 4 is 2,
plus a remainder of 3.

Must we always have a binding? No, not necessarily. And a binding need not be adequate to reconstruct
the example. A binding is merely a bit of metadata concerning how something is a member of a certain
category. ::

  class XModN(Category):
    """Category whose instances leave a remainder of X when divided by N.

    X should be a number between 0 and N-1, inclusive.
    """

    def __init__(self, x, n):
      self.x = x
      self.n = n
      if n == 0:
        raise FargError("Modulo 0 makes no sense")
      if x < 0 or x >= n:
        raise FargError("x must be between 0 and %d:  %d mod %d not supported" % (n - 1, x, n))

    def BriefLabel(self):
      return "%d mod %d" % (self.x, self.n)

    def IsInstance(self, entity):
      magnitude = entity.magnitude
      remainder = magnitude % self.n
      if remainder == self.x:
        return Binding(k=(magnitude - self.x) / self.n)
      return None

This newly creates category can be used thus::

  mod_3_4 = XModN(3, 4)
  i7 = IntegerObject(7)
  i7.DescribeAs(mod_3_4)


Is Square() == Square()?
--------------------------

Yes. The class :py:class:`~farg.core.categorization.category.Category` has the metaclass 
:py:class:`~farg.core.meta.MemoizedConstructor`, which enforces that a constructor caches the objects
it produces, and returns the same object when called with the same constructor. This implies that
you can cheaply call XModN(3, 4) hundreds of times even if the constructor is expensive: the cost is
incurred only once. Of course, XModN(4, 5) is a different object.

In this sense, Square() is like a global.
