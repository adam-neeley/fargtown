"""The python version of Seqsee.

Why this exists: Most code in app/seqsee is over 4 years old, and is hacky. As I
understand better where I want to take this, I want to start from a clean slate.
That said, I want to do it gradually: replace one bit at a time with something
simpler and cleaner.

I will add new bits here, with plenty of tests, and slowly switch over code from
there.
